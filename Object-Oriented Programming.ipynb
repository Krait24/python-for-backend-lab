        "\n",
        "> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"[objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science))\", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "This is in contrast to [procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming). If you are just learning how to program now, procedural programming is likely more akin to what you've been doing up until this point, though you've likely worked with a number of paradigms, possibly without realizing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The focus of procedural programming is to break down a programming task into a collection of [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)), [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure), and [subroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine), whereas in [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) it is to break down a programming task into objects that expose behavior (methods) and data (members or attributes) using interfaces. The most important distinction is that while procedural programming uses procedures to operate on data structures, object-oriented programming bundles the two together, so an \"object\", which is an instance of a class, operates on its \"own\" data structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#what-is-python). For simplicity we will only be using Python in the code examples in this notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "> [Python] incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows."

        "> In class-based programming, [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)) is done by defining new classes as [extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(semantics)) of existing classes: the existing class is the [parent class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)#Subclasses_and_superclasses) and the new class is the [child class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)#Subclasses_and_superclasses). If a child class has only one parent class, this is known as [_single inheritance_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#Single_inheritance), while if a child class can have more than one parent class, this is known as [_multiple inheritance_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance). This organizes classes into a [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy), _either a [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(set_theory))_ (if single inheritance) _or [lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order))_ (if multiple inheritance).\n",

        "Inheritance is an integral aspect of object-oriented programming. It is a mechanism where you can derive one class from another class. By now, you have already experimented with this concept. Now that you know really how objects work in Python, you can examine the simple code below, which creates a subclass of `dict` and `Car`, with a custom [`__eq__`]() method."
